# Implementing DevOps on AWS
This is the code repository for [Implementing DevOps on AWS](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/implementing-devops-aws?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781786460141), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

There are no code files for the following chapters:

- **Chapter 1**  - What is DevOps and Should You Care?
- **Chapter 8**  - Optimize for Scale and Cost
- **Chapter 9**  - Secure Your AWS Environment
- **Chapter 10** - Aws Tips and Tricks

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, 5585_02_CodeFiles

The code will look like the following:
       
       aws-region = "us-east-1"
       vpc-cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
       vpc-name = "Terraform"
       aws-availability-zones = "us-east-1b,us-east-1c"

### Software requirements:
The practical examples found in this book involve the use of AWS resources, thus an AWS
account will be required.

The client-side tools used in the examples, such as the AWS CLI and Terraform, are
supported on most common operating systems (Linux/Windows/Mac OS).
